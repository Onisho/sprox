        <h4>Shoe trend #1: FLORALS</h4>
        <p>Who doesn’t love a good floral? Especially during summer. There’s no need to be a girly girl to be able to rock flowers, that’s how universal this shoe trend has become. What’s also great is their versatility. Think: minimalist, monochrome appliqués, but also wild, bright prints.</p>

        <h4>Shoe trend #2: SUMMER GLOW</h4>
        <p>A little luxury in a shoe goes a long way. That’s why metallic colors and shines are such a great trend for summer footwear. And not to worry – there’s more than just gold and silver. Think about coppers, tin tones, pewter, rose gold, …</p>
        <p>So, we can agree: high gloss or subtle glow – metallics are the way to go.</p>
